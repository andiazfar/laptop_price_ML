This is my first project to share about Data Cleaning and Machine Learning.

I used Pandas as my dataframe handling tool,
and Scikit-Learn as my Machine Learning tool.

I have provided the datasets that I use in the repo as well. Please feel free to use it.
The dataset is taken from Kaggle. (Thanks Kaggle!)
